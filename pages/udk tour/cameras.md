Add a `CameraActor` into the level. That will now be the exhibition match startup camera.

You can also use the `SetCameraTarget` kismet node to use that camera instead of the car camera. Here I used that on player spawn and attached the `CameraActor` to the player so that itâ€™s inside it, creating a first person view.
