Add a `CameraActor` into the level. That will now be the exhibition match startup camera. 
{% include image.html filename="camera_1.png" alt_text="Startup Camera" %}
You can also use the `SetCameraTarget` kismet node to use that camera instead of the car camera.

Here I used that on player spawn and attached the `CameraActor` to the player so that itâ€™s inside it, creating a first person view.
{% include image.html filename="camera_2.gif" alt_text="FPS View" %}
